A Minecraft Mod based on my idears for a story called Die f√ºnf Schwerter - Schatten und Licht.
It deals with five new species. While discovering the world you maybe will choose one of them as your ones.

It is not even nearly finished yet. I only added the first structures, items and blocks and a really agressive entity called soul. Don't go into desserts when you want your world not to explode. This will be removed in near future. But for the moment it is much to fun to experiment with.

Good luck
