This is a mod based on my in writing story Die fünf Schwerter - Schatten und Licht.
It will give you the opportunity to live as one of six species (Human, Dwarf, Elf, Nithriln, Enfali, Dragonth [The Human form of Dragons. Normally they are really rare cause Dragons prefer their strong, big bodies]).

You will learn about the rules of Magic the techniques of Weapons and Exploring of the surrounding world. Maybe you learn about stone or fire. Maybe you explore the nature. Eventually you find the truth of water. But don't be afraid. You will find your light right next to your way.
